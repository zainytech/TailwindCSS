# 👩‍💻Tailwind CSS: From Scratch to Real-World Application

This project chronicles my journey learning Tailwind CSS from the ground up to building a fully responsive web page that reflects a Figma design. Here's an account of the learning process and the power of Tailwind CSS:

## 🚶‍♀️Learning Tailwind CSS Step-by-Step

1. 📐**Setting Up:**
   - I started with a vanilla HTML and CSS project, configuring Tailwind CSS according to the official documentation to ensure a clean learning slate.

2. 🔰**Utility Fundamentals:**
   - Diving into the documentation, I built a basic card using Tailwind's utility classes like `flex`, `justify-center`, and `items-center` to grasp the core concepts of building UI components with Tailwind's utility-first approach.

3. 📲**Styling and Interactions:**
   - ✔Experimenting further, I customized the card's appearance by exploring Tailwind's extensive utility classes:
     - Applied `bg-gray-200` for background color.
     - Used `p-4` for padding.
     - Incorporated `rounded-lg` for rounded corners.
   - I then delved into `hover`, `focus`, and other pseudo-class utilities to add interactivity to the card, such as changing its appearance on hover or focus.

4. 💻📲**Responsive Design:**
   - Understanding the importance of catering to various screen sizes, I learned how to leverage Tailwind's responsive utilities like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, and `xl:` to adjust the card's layout and styling across different breakpoints, ensuring a seamless user experience on all devices.

5. 👩‍🔧**Tailoring Tailwind:**
   - Tailwind's flexibility allows fine-tuning default styles. I explored customizing specific properties using CSS within the `styles` directory of the Tailwind configuration, giving me granular control over the look and feel of the card.

6. 👩‍💻**Figma to Code:**
   - 🔗With a solid foundation in Tailwind, I used a Figma design ([link](https://www.figma.com/file/iDtzvyOipZoPRBOE9kXauQ/combo-deals_h?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)) as a guide and meticulously translated it into a fully functional HTML and CSS page using Tailwind's utility classes.
